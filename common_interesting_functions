"""
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 
In mathematical terms, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

So, the first few Fibonacci numbers are:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.
